                    <p class="section-content">
                        The Tesco Bank app redesign project was undertaken to
                        address the limitations of the existing app and bring it
                        in line with modern banking standards. The goal was to
                        create a more intuitive, user-friendly experience by
                        introducing advanced features like QR-based payments,
                        spending insights, and budget tracking. This project was
                        driven by the need to simplify financial management for
                        users while enhancing the overall usability and
                        functionality of the app.</p>

                    <p class="section-content">The redesign focused on solving
                        key pain points
                        identified in the current app, such as cumbersome manual
                        transfers, lack of financial planning tools, and poor
                        prioritization of frequently used actions. By leveraging
                        user research, competitive analysis, and iterative
                        design processes, the project aimed to deliver a
                        seamless and empowering banking experience for Tesco
                        Bank customers.

                            <p class="description-content">The Tesco Bank app
                                redesign is a comprehensive overhaul of the
                                existing banking application, aimed at
                                modernizing its interface and functionality. The
                                project was executed using Figma for design and
                                prototyping, with a focus on creating a clean,
                                modern interface that aligns with Tesco’s brand
                                identity. Through usability testing and
                                iterative improvements, the redesigned app
                                delivers a more efficient and enjoyable banking
                                experience, setting a new standard for Tesco
                                Bank’s digital offerings.</p>

                            <p class="heading-item">Problem Statement:</p>
                            <p class="description-content">The current Tesco
                                Bank app suffers from several limitations that
                                hinder user experience and functionality. One
                                major issue is its outdated workflows,
                                particularly for manual bank transfers, which
                                require users to input lengthy and repetitive
                                details, leading to frustration and potential
                                errors. Additionally, the app lacks essential
                                financial tools, such as budgeting features and
                                spending insights, which are critical for users
                                who want to manage their finances effectively.
                                Another significant drawback is the poor
                                prioritization of frequently used actions, such
                                as transfers, which are buried deep within
                                menus, making them inconvenient to access.
                                Furthermore, the app does not support
                                peer-to-peer payment options, meaning users
                                cannot request money through modern methods like
                                QR codes or shareable links, which are now
                                standard in many competing banking apps. These
                                limitations collectively create a cumbersome and
                                less user-friendly experience for Tesco Bank
                                customers.

                                objectives of the Tesco Bank app redesign were
                                to simplify money transfers and requests by
                                introducing QR codes and shareable links, making
                                transactions faster and more convenient.
                                Additionally, the redesign aimed to empower
                                users by incorporating budgeting tools and
                                spending insights, enabling them to track
                                expenses and manage their finances more
                                effectively. To enhance usability, frequently
                                used actions, such as recent transactions, were
                                prioritized on the homepage, allowing users to
                                access key features with ease. Finally, the

                                ensuring a seamless and enjoyable banking

                                The foundation of the Tesco Bank app redesign
                                was built on a robust research and planning
                                phase, ensuring that every design decision was
                                data-driven and user-focused. To understand the
                                competitive landscape, I conducted a detailed
                                analysis of leading banking apps like Revolut,
                                Monzo, and Starling Bank, identifying best
                                practices in areas such as QR payments,
                                budgeting tools, and user interface design. This
                                competitive benchmarking helped me establish a
                                clear direction for the project.<br>

                                Next, I dove into user research by analyzing app
                                reviews and conducting hypothetical user
                                interviews to uncover pain points and unmet
                                needs. Key insights revealed that users were
                                frustrated with the manual entry of bank details
                                for transfers, the lack of financial management
                                tools, and the inconvenient placement of
                                frequently used actions. Armed with these
                                findings, I defined the project’s goals: to
                                simplify money transfers, introduce budgeting
                                and spending insights, and create a more
                                intuitive and modern interface. This research
                                phase ensured that the redesign would not only
                                address current limitations but also align with
                                user expectations and industry standards.

                                wireframes to map out user flows for key
                                features, such as QR-based payments and budget
                                tracking. These wireframes allowed me to
                                experiment with different layouts and
                                interactions, ensuring that the final design
                                would be both functional and intuitive.<br>

                                For the visual design, I adopted a minimalist
                                and modern approach, using Tesco’s brand colors
                                (blue and white) to maintain consistency while
                                introducing subtle gradients and shadows to add
                                depth. I prioritized accessibility by ensuring
                                sufficient contrast and readability, and I used
                                component-based design in Figma to create a
                                scalable and maintainable design system. This
                                approach not only streamlined the design process
                                but also ensured consistency across all
                                screens.<br>

                                To bring the design to life, I created an
                                interactive prototype in Figma, simulating the
                                user experience of key features like QR payments
                                and budget tracking. This prototype was
                                instrumental in visualizing the app’s
                                functionality and served as a valuable tool for
                                gathering feedback during usability testing. By
                                combining modern design principles with a
                                user-centric approach, I was able to create a
                                design that was both visually appealing and
                                highly functional.

                        <!-- Development & Implementation -->
                        <div class="grid-row">
                            <p class="heading-item">Development &
                                Implementation:</p>
                            <p class="description-content">
                                The development phase focused on translating the
                                design into a functional and user-friendly app,
                                incorporating modern technologies and best
                                practices to ensure a seamless experience. One
                                of the key features implemented was QR code
                                generation and scanning, which allows users to
                                send and request money instantly without the
                                need for manual bank details. This feature was
                                built with security in mind, ensuring that all
                                transactions were encrypted and compliant with
                                banking regulations.<br>

                                Another major addition was the spending insights
                                feature, which provides users with a visual
                                breakdown of their expenses by category (e.g.,
                                food, transportation). This feature leverages
                                data visualization techniques to present complex
                                information in an easy-to-understand format,
                                helping users make informed financial decisions.
                                Additionally, I introduced budget tracking with
                                progress bars, enabling users to set and monitor
                                budgets for customizable categories.<br>

                                To enhance usability, I prioritized quick-access
                                recent transactions on the homepage, allowing
                                users to view and repeat their most frequent
                                actions with just a few taps. This feature was
                                designed to save time and reduce friction,
                                making the app more efficient for everyday use.
                                Throughout the development process, I
                                collaborated closely with developers to ensure
                                that the design was implemented accurately and
                                that all features functioned as intended. By
                                combining modern design techniques with a focus
                                on user needs, I was able to deliver a
                                redesigned app that not only looks great but
                                also provides a superior user experience.
